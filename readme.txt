This is sports statistic app. Done using MEAN -stack. Main idea is to handle book keeping of event in a game. Originally done for basketball, but can be used on other sports too. Just need to add row for events collected to the database and add necessary texts to translations files. Backend and frontend are separated, so both need to be started separately.

- Front end: Angular.JS and Bootstrap
- Back end: Node.JS, Express.js and MongoDB
